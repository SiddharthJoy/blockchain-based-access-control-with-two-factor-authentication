# Smart Contract Based Access Control for IoT devices with Two Factor Authentication (Access Control Policy + Digital Signature)

# **OVERVIEW**
In this research, we provide a decentralized access control architecture for Internet of Things (IoT) systems based on smart contracts. Nowadays, IoT is present in practically all spheres of human activity, including healthcare, smart cities, and transportation. IoT (Internet of Things) applications are becoming more prevalent, which means that more sensitive data, such as private or secret information, is being generated. As a result, there are more security and privacy risks for IoT systems. Effective access control is necessary in IoT to protect user privacy. Because IoT systems have complicated administration and centralization, traditional access control methods are inappropriate for them. As a result, distributed security techniques are required to ensure the security of such systems. Blockchain is, at its core, a decentralized platform on which every transaction is carried out decentralized. In this work, a smart contract-based access control system with two-factor authentication was suggested. In our architecture, a user cannot access IoT resources until a successful authorization and digital signature verification has taken place. The system also penalizes users who try to use IoT resources without authorization. The smart contract was built with Remix and deployed on the Ropsten Ethereum testnet.
